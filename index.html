      <h1>40 days of coding</h1>
    </header>

    <p class="intro">After finishing my web development course at General Assembly in November 2016, I was looking at a nice long summer of (probable) unemployment. As a way to keep myself busy and keep myself coding, I set about to complete as many projects as I could in 40 days. Are they finished products? No. Are they buggy as heck? Yes. These are not polished projects, but they were a lot of fun and enabled me to play around with new technologies and keep learning, which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
